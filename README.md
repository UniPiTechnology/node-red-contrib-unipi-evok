# node-red-contrib-unipi-evok
This module provides two nodes in Node-RED to quickly access the UniPi device. For more information about UniPi devices see <a href="https://www.unipi.technology/">here</a>.

To connect the nodes with the UniPi device the EVOK utility in version 2.0 or higher is required to install. See <a href="https://github.com/UniPiTechnology/evok">UniPi GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.unipi.technology/cs/content/evok-18">UniPi EVOK</a> for more information.

To connect - Node-RED and the UniPi device - use the websocket node which is set as `connect to` on the adress ws://[adress of the UniPi device]/ws.

## Pre-requisites

The node-red-contrib-unipi-evok requires <a href="https://nodered.org">Node-RED</a> to be installed.

## Install

 Use the `Menu - Manage palette` to install the UniPi nodes and search for `node-red-contrib-unipi-evok`, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

    npm install @unipitechnology/node-red-contrib-unipi-evok

## Usage

#### Basic information
Once `@unipitechnology/node-red-contrib-unipi-evok` is installed into the Node-RED two nodes are added:

   - **UniPi input** node - primary a filter for the UniPi data (from the websocket). Helps to easily access the needed data and work with them throw the flow/s.
   - **UniPi output** node - helps to see the ***all*** data by the request, ***filter*** the choosen data or to ***set*** the features *relay*, *digital output* and *led* -> to switch ON/OFF or set *analog output* to desired value. 
#### Preparation
To connect the UniPi device with the Node-RED the UniPi EVOK utility <a href="https://www.unipi.technology/cs/content/evok-18">EVOK</a> has to be installed on the device.

Once one has ***UniPi Control Panel*** (which is the enviroment of the EVOK utility in one's browser) active then the first needed step is done. Copy the adress from the console (the form is e.g. 78.230.110.45:8080) and paste it to the websocket node in form ws://[adress of the UniPi device]/ws (with the previous example of the adress it looks like: ws://78.230.110.45:8080/ws) and set the websocket node as ***connect to***.

#### Connection
Now only connect the *websocket input node* with the *UniPi input node* and/or the *UniPi output node* with the *websocket output node*. *Input* couple serves as a *data input (to Node-RED)* from the UniPi device and *output* couple serves as a *data output (from Node-RED)* to the UniPi device.
